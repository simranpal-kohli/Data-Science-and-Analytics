# Data-Visualisation
This repository contains data Visualisation project.  
I have added RMD file.  
I have added the main aim of this project below with all the questions.  
I have added a solution file in .docx format.

Question 1

Patrick, the manager of a telecommunication company wants to apply analytical techniques so that he can predict if a RF radio mast, used in mobile phone communication, is susceptible to outages due to adverse weather conditions. To this end he would like you to use appropriate algorithms and/or machine learning techniques to aid him with this task.
Patrick’s company has a large nationwide network of RF radio masts and these are affected by ‘outages’ due to adverse weather conditions, mainly very heavy rain and heavy mist. Outages mean that there is no available mobile phone service.
To help you Patrick has commissioned an engineer to classify 2,186 radio masts are either okay – i.e. not susceptible to adverse weather conditions and under, i.e. under engineered and so susceptible to adverse weather conditions. 
He has also supplied you with a scoring dataset of 936 radio masts for you to classify as whether okay or
Under.

a)	Investigate the data by carrying out some exploratory data analysis (EDA). Perform the necessary data cleaning/data reduction tasks and outline how you do this in R.

b)	Set up a training/testing methodology. Using a least 2 models, tune these models and compare your results. Give your best model and comment.

c)	Perform feature selection on your model in c). Explain how you do this, giving a rational and comment on your results.

d)	For your best model explain to Patrick how this model works. Give and explain the cost/loss function used in your modelling.

e)	Patrick is primarily concerned with finding the under engineered masts as these are the ones that cause outages, so incorrectly ‘scoring’ a mast as under when is it okay is not as bad as incorrectly ‘scoring’ a mast as okay when it is under; you can take the ratio here of misclassification ‘costs’ as 1:h, where h = {8, 16, 24}, i.e. h can take a value of 8, 16 or 24. Redo your modelling using your best model above and comment on your new results.

f)	Using the scoring data set provided predict whether these radio masts will be okay or under engineered using your best model to part d) and comment.
